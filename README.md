Code for the book [ *Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell* by Simon Marlow](https://simonmar.github.io/pages/pcph.html).

The book is a decade old but still up-to-date! How many books in the CS can say that about themselves?

Thank you Simon for writing the book, the code for the book, the code for the Haskell runtime and everything you've done for the Haskell community!
